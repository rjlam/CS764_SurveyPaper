Questions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Do we cite the journal version or the conference version? Many of our classic papers have both.
\item Becky: do we want a saner bibtex entry naming system (eg file name?).
\end{enumerate}

This is the paper that started it all: \cite{Guttman:1984:RDI:971697.602266}.

\section{R Tree variants}
This is an R-tree that's theoretically optimal, avoiding worst-case bounds etc \cite{Arge:2004:PRP:1007568.1007608}.
Naturally, I think this is very interesting.

The X-Tree! \cite{DBLP:conf/vldb/BerchtoldKK96}.

The R*-tree \cite{Beckmann:1990:RER:93605.98741}.

The R+-tree \cite{DBLP:conf/vldb/SellisRF87}.

\section{Database applications}
This sounds like a very nice (and thoroughly cited) DB application of R-trees: \cite{Brinkhoff:1993:EPS:170035.170075}

Buffering! More DB stuff, I think: \cite{DBLP:conf/vldb/BiveinisSJ07}.

This is an R-Tree augmented with version history (I think? Obviously still need to read the paper). \cite{Nascimento:1998:THR:330560.330692}.

Packing R-Trees: a much more efficient way of building them, fewer rectangles etc. \cite{Kamel:1993:PR:170088.170403}.

\section{Experiments!}
This is a modern and not-very-cited paper, but they do stuff we may be interested in:
\cite{DBLP:conf/ssd/HwangKCL03}.
